### RECURSIVE THINKING - SEATTLE DEV DAY ###

*** How do I run the app? ***
- npm run start

*** None of the API Calls are working, it seems broke ***
- your missing a config file in ./src/config.js , create the
  file and copy the JSON available through the Recursive Thinking
  DevDayWebsite Channel.
- your also missing a critical step, gotta set up the AWS CLI yo.  Heres a link
  http://serverless-stack.com/chapters/configure-the-aws-cli.html
  FOR THE ACCESS KEY AND SECRET ACCCES KEY SEE THE DEVDAYWEBSITE SLACK CHANNEL
   I PROVISIONED A USER FOR THIS IN MY ACCOUNT

*** How do I submit a pull request ***
- Google it.  :0 Github also has a GUI.  don't tell me if you use it.

*** What should I do before I submit a pull request ***
- Unless your pull request is to add unit tests... we don't have tests atm so you
  should probably test that $#@$

*** But what if I don't understand Austin's sloppy code ***
- Let's see what you can do in 8 hours.  I'll be happy to accept it if its better.
  My aim was to get the piping working ASAP.

*** What needs work? ***
  - unit tests
  - icons for things like social buttons and such.
  - css fixes
  - features? How about a chat page? A news page hooked up to an S3 bucket where we can
    leave news posts about dev day events.
  - anything your heart desires.  if it sux then I just wont accept the pull request.
